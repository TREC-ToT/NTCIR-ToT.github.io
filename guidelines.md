## Task definition

In terms of input and output, the movie identification task is relatively straightforwardâ€”given an input TOT request, output a ranked list of movies.  Each movie must be identified by its Wikipedia page id and the correct movie should be ranked as high as possible.  For each query, runs should return a ranked list of 1000 Wikipedia page ids.  Runs will be evaluated using IR metrics that are appropriate for IR tasks with one relevant document, such as discounted gain and reciprocal rank.
