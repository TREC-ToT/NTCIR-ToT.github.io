# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

title: TREC 2023 Tip-of-the-Tongue (ToT) Track
email: bmitra@microsoft.com
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  The Tip-of-the-Tongue (ToT) Track focuses on the known-item identification
  task where the searcher has previously experienced or consumed the item
  (e.g., a movie) but cannot recall a reliable identifier (i.e., "It's on the
  tip of my tongueâ€¦"). Unlike traditional ad-hoc keyword-based search, these
  information requests tend to be natural-language, verbose, and complex
  containing a wide variety of search strategies such as multi-hop reasoning,
  and frequently express uncertainty and suffer from false memories.
baseurl: "/site" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://trec-tot.github.io/" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
